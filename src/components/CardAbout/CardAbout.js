            3. BSC is the most popular low-gas decentralized network, and we
            believe that it is currently optimal for attracting both retail and
            institutional investors, particularly for lottery-focused
            decentralized applications.

            4. Existing lottery projects suffer from the need to maintain high
            trading volume with high fees for lottery payouts. BSCWIN pioneers
            the crypto lottery space using an advanced liquidity-lottery payout
            mechanism to address this issue.

            5. BSCWIN incorporates a custom weighted random sampling algorithm
            for completely random and fair selection of winners. Participants
            just need to buy and hold at least 1 $BSCWIN to be eligible for
            lottery draws.
